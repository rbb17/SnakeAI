# SnakeAI

Snake AI with PyTorch

This project teaches you how to build an AI agent to play the classic game Snake using Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch and Pygame [1].
Project Overview

## The project guides you through building the AI in four parts:

    Reinforcement Learning & Deep Q-Learning: Gain foundational knowledge of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q-Learning, the technique used to train the AI agent [1].
    Environment Setup and Snake Game Implementation: Set up the development environment and implement the core mechanics of the Snake game [1].
    AI Agent Implementation: Build the AI agent responsible for controlling the snake's movements [1].
    Neural Network for Move Prediction and Training: Implement a neural network that predicts the best moves for the AI and train it through Deep Q-Learning [1].

## Getting Started

This project uses Python libraries like PyTorch and Pygame. Make sure you have them installed before diving in.
How to Use

Refer to the source code for details on running the project in two modes:

    Manual Play: Control the snake yourself using the arrow keys.
    AI Training: Train the AI agent using Deep Q-Learning.
